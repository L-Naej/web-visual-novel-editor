# Web Visual Novel Editor
Mini visual novel editor for now in plain HTML5/CSS3/Javascript ES6, running in local (no need of a server).
Made just for fun, my goal right now is to make it without using canvas, and if possible without external library or framework (we'll see!).

Novels are stored in JSON with assets being url referencing images (not secure right now).

*Status: just started, minimalist prototype phase.*


**Very ugly right now, design has not been worked on yet.**
